# NLP---Using-CNN-and-RNN-Deep-Learning-Models-to-classify-reviews-into-positive-and-negative
The dataset is from GroupLense-To implement recommender System
Pitch
Reading customer reviews to understand their experiences is vital for businesses to identify strengths 
and weaknesses. Using CNN and RNN models, I categorized magazine subscription reviews into Positive, 
Negative, and Neutral categories. The objective was to predict sentiment, enabling businesses to make 
informed decisions based on customer feedback.
Data Source
To build this NLP system, I trained my model on the reviews data in the Magazine Subscriptions dataset. 
The Magazine Subscriptions dataset contains over 80 thousands of reviews by users, as well as 
additional information such as magazine title and user id. To get the dataset we have two options:
• from amazon website.
